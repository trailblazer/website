<%= h2 "STRATEGY" %>

<%= h3 "Path" %>

The simplest strategy is `Path`, which does nothing but connecting each task's `:success` output to the following task.

<%= code "step", collapse: "mod" %>

Without any additional DSL options, this results in a straight path.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/path.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

In turn, this means that only `true` return values in your tasks will work. The DSL will, per default, wrap every task with the `Binary` interface, meaning returning `true` will result in `Activity::Right`, and false in `Activity::Left`. Currently, only `Right` signals are wired up.

<%= h4 "Output" %>

You may add as many outputs to a task as you need. The DSL provides the `Output()` helper to do so.

<%= code "validate", collapse: "mod" %>

The `Path` strategy only maintains the `:success`/`Activity::Right` semantic/signal combination. Any other combination you need to define explicitly using `Output(signal, semantic)`.

<%= h4 "End" %>

The `End()` helper allows creating a new end event labelled with the specified semantic.

<%= code "validate", collapse: "mod" %>

This will result in the following circuit.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/path-end.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

The `validate` task now has a `success` and a `failure` output. Since it's wrapped using `Binary` it may return `true` or `false` to dictate the used output (or `Activity::Right`/`Activity::Left` since it's the [task interface]).

<%= code "validate", collapse: "flow" %>

The activity will halt on the `:invalid`-labelled end if `validate` was falsey.

<%= code "validate-call", collapse: "flow" %>

<%= h4 "Multiple References" %>

Note that repeatedly using the same semantic (`End(:semantic)`) will reference the same end event.

<%= code "double-end", collapse: "mod" %>

Since we're adding a `:failure` output, `create` now has two outgoing connections.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/double-end.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

<%= h3 "Railway" %>

The [`Railway` pattern](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) is used for "automatic" error handling. You arrange your actual chain of logic on the "success" track, if a problem occurs, the processing jumps to the parallel "failure" track, skipping the rest of the tasks on the success track.

Once on the failure track, it stays there (unless you instruct not to do so!).

<%= vite_image_tag "images/railway.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

Three possible execution paths this activity might take.

* No errors: First `validate`, then `create`, then ends in `End.success`. The activity was successful.
* Validation error: First `validate`, which returns a `Left` (failure) signal, leading to `log_error`, then `End.failure`.
* Creation error: First `validate`, then `create`, which deviates to the failure track, leading to `End.failure`. Note this doesn't hit the logging error handler due to the sequence order.

To place tasks on the failure track, use `#fail`. Note that the order of tasks corresponds to the order in the Railway.

<%= code "railway", collapse: "mod" %>

Obviously, you may use as many tasks as you need on both tracks. There are no limitations.

<%= info do %>
Historically, the success path is called "right" whereas the error handling track is "left". The signals `Right` and `Left` in Trailblazer are still named following this convention.
<% end %>

<%= h4 "Wiring" %>

All wiring features apply to `Railway`. You can rewire, add or remove connections as you please.

<%= code "railway-wire", collapse: "mod" %>

Railway automatically connects a task's `success` output to the next possible task available on the success track. Vice-verse, the `failure` output is connected the the new possible task on the failure path.

Here, `create`'s failure output is reconnected.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/railway-wire.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

<%= h4 "Fail" %>

DSL's `#fail` method allows to place tasks on the failure track.

Such error handlers are still wrapped using `Binary`. In other words, they can still return a `Right` or `Left` signal. However, per default, both outputs are connected to the next task on the failure track.

You may rewire or add outputs on failure tasks, too.

<%= code "railway-fail", collapse: "mod" %>

For instance, it's possible to jump back to the success path if `log_error` decides to do so.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/railway-fail.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

The return value of `log_error` now does matter.

<%= code "railway-fail", collapse: "flow" %>

<%= h4 "Pass" %>

If the return value of a "right" task shouldn't matter, use `#pass`.

<%= code "railway-pass", collapse: "mod" %>

Regardless of `create`'s return value, it will always flow to the next success task.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/railway-pass.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

Both outputs are connected to the following task on the success path (or, in this case, the success end).

<%= h4 "Notes" %>

FIXME

* Using `Railway`, tasks always get two outputs assigned: `:success/Right` and `:failure/Left`.

<%= h3 "FastTrack" %>

Based on the `Railway` strategy, the `FastTrack` pattern allows to "short-circuit" tasks and leave the circuit at specified events.

<%= info do %>
The infamous `Trailblazer::Operation` is a thin public API around `Activity::FastTrack`.
<% end %>

<%= h4 "PassFast" %>

The `:pass_fast` option wires the `:success` output straight to the new `pass_fast` end.

<%= code "ft-passfast", collapse: "mod" %>

If `validate` returns a true value, it will skip the remaining tasks on the success track and end in `End.pass_fast`.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/ft-passfast.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

Note that in the example, the `create` task not accessable anymore.

<%= h4 "FailFast" %>

The counter-part for `:pass_fast` is `:fail_fast`.

<%= code "ft-failfast", collapse: "mod" %>

A falsey return value from `#validate` will deviate the flow and go straight to `End.fail_fast`.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/ft-failfast.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

Again, this specific example renders the `log_errors` task unreachable.

<%= h4 "FastTrack" %>

It's possible to wire a task to the two FastTrack ends `End.fail_fast` and `End.pass_fast` in addition to the normal Railway wiring.

<%= code "ft-fasttrack", collapse: "mod" %>

The `validate` task now has four outputs. You can instruct the two new FastTrack outputs by returning either `Trailblazer::Activity::FastTrack::FailFast` or `Trailblazer::Activity::FastTrack::PassFast` (see also [returning signals]).

Note that you don't have to use both outputs.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/ft-fasttrack.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

The standard FastTrack setup allows you to communicate and model up to four states from one task.

<%= h4 "Notes" %>

FIXME

* All options (`:pass_fast`, `:fail_fast` and `:fast_track`) may be used with `step`, `pass` or `fail`. If in doubt, [render the circuit].
* `:pass_fast` and `:fail_fast` can be used in combination.
