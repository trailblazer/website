<%= h3 "Input / Output" %>

Before the introduction of the composable `In()`, `Out()` and `Inject()` filters, variable mapping was done with the `:input` and `:output` option. This is still supported and not planned to be dropped. However, there are a bunch of drawbacks with using the monolithic, non-composable options.

<%= info do %>
With `trailblazer-2.1.1` and the bundled `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear-1.0.0` gems, the recommended way of I/O is using [composable variable mapping]() via `In()` and `Out()`.
<% end %>

<%= vite_image_tag "images/input.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

The `:input` filter is normally used to create a new context that limits what its task sees.


<%= vite_image_tag "images/output.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

With the `:output` filter, you can control what variables go from the inner scoped context to the outer.



Without any I/O configuration, all values written in a task to `ctx` will be visible in the following tasks. This might - sometimes - lead to context pollution or, even worse, certain tasks "seeing" wrong values.

When using the DSL, the filter options `:input` and `:output` are your interface for variable mapping.

Please note that I/O works for both "simple" tasks as well as nested activities.

<%= h4 "Overview" %>

The variable mapping API provides some shortcuts to control the scope.

<%= code "io-ary-hash", collapse: "io-steps" %>

An array value such as `[:params]` passed to `:input` will result in the configured task only "seeing" the provided list of variables. All other values are not available, mimicking a whitelist.

A hash value (e.g. `{user: :current_user}`) acts like a variable mapping directive. With `:output`, it will only expose the variables mentioned in the hash, but rename them to the specifed value.

<%= code "io-auth", collapse: "io-steps" %>

In the `#authorize` example, the following happens.

1. The task receives a context with only one variable set, which is `:params` passed into the activity invocation.
2. In the task, it may write (and pollute) the `ctx` object as much as it wants. It's a scoped, private ctx object that will be discarded after the task is finished. This leads to the `:result` variable being thrown away.
3. Before the private `ctx` gets disposed of, its `:user` key gets copied into the original `ctx` under the name `:current_user`.
4. The following task `create_model` will see the original ctx plus `:current_user` that was written in the previous step using `:output`.

<%= code "io-call", collapse: "io-steps" %>

An array passed to `:output` will exclusively copy the specified variables to the original ctx, only.

A hash passed to `:input` results in the called task only "seeing" the specified variables, but renamed to the hash values.

<%= h4 "Callable" %>

As usual, you may provide your own code for dynamic filtering or renaming.

<%= code "io-proc", collapse: "mod" %>

From the `:input` callable, you can return a hash containing the values that `#authorize` may see. All other variables you don't include in that hash will be unavailable. This is called a _scope_ and resembles the arguments you pass into a normal Ruby method along with a method that doesn't have access to variables outside its scope.

Trailblazer will automatically create a new `Context` object around your custom input hash. You can write to that without interferring with the original context.

The `:output` callable receives the scoped, new context object that you wrote to in `#authorize`. In `:output`, you return the hash of variables that you want to be visible in the following steps. This hash will be automatically merged into the original context.

In both filters, you're able to rename and coerce variables. This gives you a bit more control than the simpler DSL.

<%= h4 "Filter Methods" %>

For better readability, you may use instance methods for your filters.

<%= code "io-method" %>

They receive the identical set of arguments that other callables are called with.

<%= h4 "Keyword Arguments" %>

You may use keyword arguments in your filters for type safety and better readable code.

<%= code "io-kws" %>

* `:input` provides all variables from the original context as kw args.
* `:output` will receive a list of all variables you added to the scoped, inner context.

<%= h4 "With Outer Ctx" %>

It is possible to access the outer context (in addition to the inner ctx) in an `:output` filter using the `:output_with_outer_ctx` DSL option.

<%= code "io-output-positionals" %>

The `:output` filter then receives a second positional argument which is the original, outer context. This is helpful if you want to merge new values into existing datastructures, such as error objects.

As usual, the returned hash is then merged into the outer context.

<%= info do %>
The `:output_with_outer_ctx` option is available since `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear-0.4.0`.
<% end %>

<%= h4 "Notes" %>

&nbsp;

* You can mix any `:input` style with any `:output` style.
* **CTX MANAGEMENT** Using I/O filters always results in a new, scoped context being created in `:input` (containing your filtered variables), and disposing of that very context in `:output` (copying desired variables over to the original ctx).
* **LOW-LEVEL API** Please note that the I/O DSL is only providing the most-used requirements. Feel free to use the low-level taskWrap API to build your own variable mapping with different scoping techniques.
* **DEFAULTS** When omitting either `:input` or `:output`, defaults will be provided. Default `:input` will pass through all variables. Default `:output` copies all written variables from the scoped context to the original one.



<%= h2 "Dependency Injection" %>

<%= info do %>
WIP: This section is not final, yet.
TODO: maybe use Operation API instead?
<% end %>

<%= h3 "Overview" %>

Very often your activity or one of the steps contained require particular objects and values to get their job done. Instead of hard-wiring those _"dependencies"_ in the code it is good style to allow providing those objects by passing them into the activity at run-time. This is called dependency injection and is a [common technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) in software engineering.

One way for using dependency injection is using keyword arguments for variables you need, and defaulting those in the step signature.

<%= code "write-defaulted" %>

The `#write` step requires a variable `:time`, which is a dependency. The variable's default is hard-wired and applied if no other value is provided. However, by injecting `:time` when invoking the activity, you can override this value at run-time.

<%= code "inject-log-time" %>

This is extremely helpful when you have to replace a "hard-wired" dependency, for example in a test where you want to know and define `:time`'s value upfront.

<%= h3 "Inject" %>

The `:inject` option allows to pass through injected variables without having to add them in the `:input` filter code. It also provides a way to default variables should they not have been passed from the outside.

<%= info do %>
The `:inject` was introduced in `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear` 0.4.3 and is still considered experimental. Use it, but be reasonable and keep in mind that syntactical API might change.
<% end %>

When using `:inject` **without** `:input` there won't be any filtering happening. The original ctx with all its variables will be passed into the step.

As usual, the option can be used with both nested operations/activities and callable steps.

<%= h4 "Qualified Pass-through" %>

The most commonly used style for `:inject` is the pass-through array. When used in combination with `:input` this allows to reduce the `:input` filter code.

Check the following snippet. It's a common pattern in many TRB applications to use an `:input` filter to limit variables going into the subprocess. Anyways, when you have defaulted variables in the subprocess, you should only add those to your `:input` when they're actually defined by the invoker - or passed from the outside.

<%= code "clumsy-merge" %>

Quickly, the code gets messy as you constantly need to check whether or not the dependency is injected.

<%= h4 "array style" %>

Use the `:inject` option to automatically add injected variables when they're present in `ctx`.

<%= code "inject-array" %>

Depending on the variables passed into the activity, the `ctx` going into `Log` will look as follows.

<%= code :ruby do  %>
#                                 ctx for {Log}
Create.({})                  #=> {model: XXX}
Create.({time: "yesterday"}) #=> {model: XXX, time: "yesterday"}
<% end %>

Note that this (currently) only has effects when combined with `:input`.

<%= h4 "defaulting" %>

Instead of defaulting injected variables in the method signature, you can define a more convenient defaulting injection using `:inject`. Obviously, the affected steps should not use defaulted kwargs for variables that have defaulting happen via `:inject`.

<%= code "write-required" %>

In this example, we use Ruby's defaulting for the `:time` kwarg, and make `:date` a required kwarg without any defaulting.


The `:inject` option with a hash allows for configuring defaulting for any number of injected variables.

<%= code "inject-default" %>

In the proc, you have access to the original `ctx` and its variables via keyword arguments.

Depending on the variables passed into the activity, the `ctx` going into `Log` will look as follows.

<%= code :ruby do  %>
#                                         ctx for {Log}
Create.({})                           #=> {model: XXX, date: <today>}
Create.({time: "now", date: "today"}) #=> {model: XXX, time: "now", date: "today"}
<% end %>

Note that defaulted injects are always processed and either added to the original context when used without `:input` or to the new, filtered context when using it in combination with `:input`.
