`#step` and friends accept a bunch of options in order to insert a task at a specific location, add pre-defined connections and outputs, or even configure its taskWrap.

<%= h3 "magnetic_to" %>

In combination with [`Track()`], the `:magnetic_to` option allows for a neat way to spawn custom tracks outside of the conventional Railway or FastTrack schema.

The `failure` output of the `find_provider` task will now snap to the next task being `:magnetic_to` its semantic - which obviously is the `charge_paypal` task.

When creating a new branch (or path) in this way, it's a matter of repeating the use of `Track()` and `:magnetic_to` to add more tasks to the branch.
