<%= h3 "Subprocess" %>

While you could nest an activity into another manually, the `Subprocess` macro will come in handy.

Consider the following nested activity.

<%= code "nested", collapse: :methods %>

Use `Subprocess` to nest it into the `Create` activity.

<%= code "container", collapse: :methods %>

The macro automatically wires all of `Validate`'s ends to the known counter-part tracks.

The `Subprocess` macro will go through all outputs of the nested activity, query their semantics and search for tracks with the same semantic.

Note that the failure track starting from `create_model` will skip the nested activity, just as if it was simple task.

<%= h4 "Wiring" %>

You can use the familiar DSL to reconnect ends.

<%= code "reconnect", collapse: :methods %>

The nested's `failure` output now goes to the outer `success` track.

<%= img "nesting-reconnect.png" %>

In this example, regardless of nested's outcome, it will always be interpreted as a successful invocation.

<%= h4 "End" %>

A nested activity doesn't have to have two ends, only.

<%= code "end-nested", collapse: :methods %>

`Subprocess` will try to match the nested ends' semantics to the tracks it knows. You may wire custom ends using `Output`.

<%= code "end", collapse: :methods %>

The new special end is now wired to the `failure` track of the containing activity.

<%= img "nesting-end.png" %>

There will be an exception thrown if you don't connect unknown ends.
