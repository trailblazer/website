For branching out a separate path in an activity, use the `Path()` macro. It's a convenient, simple way to declare alternative routes, even if you could do everything it does manually.

<%= code_tabs "path", collapse: "meths" %>

If `#decide_type` returns false, the path will be executed and terminate on the new terminus `End.with_cc` because of the `:terminus` option.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/path-cc.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

Note that you don't necessarily have to reuse the `:failure` output in order to branch out a new path. You might as well use an [additional signal](#activity-wiring-api-path-railway), or any other predefined output of the task.

<%= h4 "Join" %>

If you want the path to reconnect and join the activity at some point, use the `:connect_to` option.

<%= code_tabs "path-join", collapse: "meths" %>

There won't be an additional terminus created.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/path-join.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

<%= h4 "Railway" %>

You can use `Path()` in any Trailblazer strategy, for example in `Railway`.

<%= code_tabs "path-railway", collapse: "meths" %>

In this example, we add a third output to `#decide_type` to handle the credit card payment scenario (you could also "override" or re-configure the existing `:failure` or `:success` outputs).

<%= vite_image_tag "images/path-railway.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

Only when `decide_type` returns `MySignal`, the new path alternative is taken.

<%= code "path-decider", collapse: "meths" %>

`Output()` in combination with `Path()` allows for a simple modeling of alternative routes.

<%= h4 "End_task/End_id Deprecation" %>

In older versions before `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear-1.2.0`, connecting the `Path()` to a separate terminus required you to pass two  options `:end_task` and `:end_id`.

<%= code :ruby do %>
Output(...) => Path(end_task: Activity::End.new(semantic: :valid), end_id: "End.valid") do
  # ...
end
<% end %>

This is now simplified (and more consistent) by introducing the `:terminus` option.

<%= code :ruby do %>
Output(...) => Path(terminus: :valid) do
  # ...
end
<% end %>

If you haven't updated your code you will see a deprecation warning.

<%= code :ruby do %>
[Trailblazer] <file.rb> Using `:end_task` and `:end_id` in Path() is deprecated, use `:terminus` instead.
  Please refer to https://trailblazer.to/2.1/docs/activity.html#activity-wiring-api-path-end_task-end_id-deprecation
