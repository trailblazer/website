<%= h2 "Nested" %>

<%= h3 "Auto_wire" %>

The recommended way of maintaining dynamically nested operations (or activities) is to use `Nested()` with the `:auto_wire` option.

<%= h4 "Output Wiring" %>

<%= h4 "Debugging" %>

Static `Nested` setups are traceable using `#wtf?`. The above examples result in a flow as follows.

<%= code "create-trace" %>

The trace is fully compatible with the Debugging API and allows compile-time introspection. For example, you can specify the path to a nested activity `Id3Tag` and inspect it.

<%= code "create-introspect" %>

Note that the ID of the nested activities are the class constants.
