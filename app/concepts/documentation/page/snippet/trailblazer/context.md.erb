<%= h2 "Context" %>

Context aka `ctx` (or plain old `options`) is a core argument-specific data structure for Trailblazer. It provides a generic, ordered read/write interface that collects mutable runtime-computed data while providing access to any compile-time information. It is extracted into its own [gem](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-context) and can also be used independently.

<%= h3 "ctx" %>

`ctx` can be initialized when an operation is invoked at the run time or by defining [dependencies](/2.1/docs/operation.html#operation-options-class-dependencies) at the compile time. Inside the operation, it gets passed down to every `step` with it's argument position depending on step's [interface](/2.1/docs/activity.html#activity-internals-circuit-interface). It will contain whatever the most recently executed step has changed and hopefully contains what you’re expecting.

<%= info do %>
  If you want to see what `ctx` modifications are being performed per step or at specific steps, you can debug it using developer's [focus_on](/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html#trailblazer-developer-wtf-focus_on) API.

`ctx`'s purpose is to hold the state of your activity which can also be passed down to other nested activities using [Subprocess](/2.1/docs/activity.html#activity-wiring-api-subprocess). You can filter what such activities can or can not "see" using [variable mapping](/2.1/docs/activity.html#activity-variable-mapping). After operation's execution using public call, the [Result](/2.1/docs/operation.html#operation-overview-result) object wraps the context for convenient access.

In order to provide the generic interface, scoping and debugging capabilities, the "Hash" argument you provide to an operation is initialized as an instance of `Trailblazer::Context::Container` to build up the final `ctx`. This allows us to support more features on top of it like indifferent access, aliasing etc

<%= h4 "Indifferent Access" %>

`ctx` mimics as "Hash" and also allows you to use Strings or Symbols interchangeably as keys; similar to the `params` hash in Rails.

<%= code 'ctx-indifferent-access' %>

All keys are stored as Symbols by default in order to allow them to be accessible as keyword arguments.
Note that `ctx` doesn't provide interchangeable keys for any nested hashes because of the performance reasons. 

<%= h4 "Aliases" %>

Most commonly found keys in `ctx` are `'contract.default', 'contract.default.params', 'policy.default'` etc. It sometimes becomes cumbersome to access them from `ctx` as they can't be defined as keyword arguments in steps. 

To overcome this, it is possible to define a shorter versions of context keys using `aliases`. By providing aliases mapping in `flow_options[:context_options]`, context will maintain any mutations being made on the origianl keys with 
the aliases and vice versa.

<%= code 'ctx-aliases' %>

`flow_options` are passed to the nested operations via `Subprocess` and all given aliases will also be applied in them by default.
