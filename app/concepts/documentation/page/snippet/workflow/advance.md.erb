The `trailblazer-workflow` gem is currently a paid feature. It's still unreleased and [we will inform you](http://fb.me/trailblazer_to) once it's available.

<%= h3 "domain_ctx" %>

Via the `:domain_ctx` option, you provide the context object that is directly handed into the workflow/collaboration call.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/advance-domain-ctx.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* There is no wrapping happening, so building a `Context` instance is up to you.
* After the workflow invocation, the *returned* ctx is made available under `:domain_ctx` in the outer ctx. In other words, if you want to know what has been going on in the workflow, use `:domain_ctx`.

{:resume_data} ??
{:process_model} ??
