<%= h2 "Introspect" %>

<%= h3 "Data" %>

The `#step` DSL allows to save arbitrary data in the activity's `data` field.

<%= code "data_variable", collapse: "meths" %>

Using `Introspect::Graph`, you can now read the `:model_class` variable from the `data` field.

<%= code "data_variable_read", collapse: "meths" %>

This is used internally to store and expose data like `:extensions` (which is part of the Introspect API). It's implemented in the basic normalizer in `"activity.compile_data"`.
