<%= h3 "Normalizer" %>

TODO: FILE LAYOUT

A normalizer is a pipeline of steps, a bit like a simple operation without the railway. The concept of normalizers is used in a lot of places in TRB: for processing DSL options as seen with `#step` or in Reform 3's `#property`, or even in the `Developer::Debugger`.


In the Activity DSL, every time `#step` is called, a normalizer is invoked and its steps eventually produce the task(s) and the wiring. The result is then added to the [`Sequence`](#sequence) instance.

The basic normalizer resides in [`trailblazer/activity/dsl/linear/normalizer.rb`](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear/blob/v1.2.0/lib/trailblazer/activity/dsl/linear/normalizer.rb). All additional normalizers for `#fail`, `#pass` and `#terminus` in both `Railway` and `FastTrack` (operation) are built on top of that normalizer.

<%= h4 "Extend" %>

Normalizer steps usually check for options in `ctx` and then apply logic. Suppose you want a new option `upcase_id: true` in your operation DSL that uppercase the precomputed ID.

<%= code "upcase" %>

Note that this function needs `:id`, so it has to be inserted after the ID computing step. You can extend an existing normalizer using `Normalizer.extend!`.

<%= code "normalizer-extend", collapse: :meths %>

The first argument is the activity to extend. The following arguments name the normalizers to modify. In this example, only `#step`'s normalizer will contain the `#upcase_id` step.

In the trace you can see, as expected, that only the ID for `:create_model` is uppercased.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/upcase.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

<%= h4 "Inherit" %>

The `dsl` supports the `inherit: true` option to copy over particular recorded options from the replaced step in the superclass. This is implemented in `"inherit.recall_recorded_options"`. In order to instruct the `:inherit` logic to record and reapply certain options, you need to mark those using `Record()`.

If you wanted the `:upcase_id` option to be added automatically to the user's option when using `inherit: true` the following function could be added to the above `MyNormalizer`.

<%= code "record-normalizer", collapse: "meths" %>

As `:upcase_id` is a symbol option (unlike, for example, `Out()`), the `:non_symbol_option` for `Record()` is `false.

It is added as another step to the original normalizer using `extend!`.

<%= code "record-extend", collapse: "meths" %>


<%= h2 "Wiring API" %>

As almost every task in the final activity is connected to other tasks, this wiring needs to be computed by the DSL. Two parts are required for that: the _outputs_ the task exposes and the _connectors_ where a particular output is connected to.

In order to do so, several steps such as `normalize_output_tuples` and `compile_connections` [are added]() to the basic normalizer. The logic is implemented in [`trailblazer/activity/dsl/linear/normalizer/output_tuples.rb`](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear/blob/v1.2.0/lib/trailblazer/activity/dsl/linear/normalizer/output_tuples.rb)

The actual work happens in `#compile_wirings` where the connections from each output are computed from two options: `:outputs`, which represents all exposed outputs along with their signal, and `:output_tuples` associating outputs to search strategies.

One major design guideline is that `:outputs` is simply a list of available outputs of the step. This option does not imply any outgoing connections. Those are effectivly defined by the `:output_tuples`.

<%= h3 "Outputs" %>

Internally, `:outputs` can be set in two different ways. When using `Subprocess()` this option is provided by the macro, it retrieves the outputs via the activity interface from the nested task.

When adding a simple step (e.g. an `:instance_method`) the Strategy's defaulting gets invoked, and only then! Again, none of the defaulting described in the following section is executed if the `:outputs` option is provided by a macro or `Subprocess()`.

After the outputs part is run, there will **always exist** an `:outputs` option for the following steps in the normalizers ctx.

<%= h4 "Defaulting" %>

There is a special outputs pipeline under `"activity.default_outputs"` which has the purpose to configure and provide `:outputs`.

Each Strategy subclass now adds its `:outputs` defaulting steps (e.g. [`"path.outputs"`](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear/blob/v1.2.0/lib/trailblazer/activity/path.rb#L16) or `"railway.outputs"` to that default_outputs pipeline. Currently, the implementation is a bit confusing as we don't have nesting in pipeline.

As an example, `Railway` will add `outputs[:failure]`.

<%= code :ruby do %>
  FAILURE_OUTPUT    = {failure: Activity::Output(Activity::Left, :failure)}
  # ...
  def add_failure_output(ctx, outputs:, **)
    ctx[:outputs] = FAILURE_OUTPUT.merge(outputs)
  end
<% end %>


The `FastTrack` normalizer conditionally adds outputs, only if the respective option (e.g. `pass_fast: true` is set.

<%= h3 "Output Tuples" %>

Once `ctx[:outputs]` is finalized, the output tuples come into play. Using the Wiring API you can configure which output goes where.

<%= code :ruby do %>
step :model,
  Output(:success) => Track(:ok) # THIS is the Wiring API!
<% end %>



Associating outputs to _connectors_ is implemented in `output_tuples.rb`. After steps of this unit have been run, a new option `ctx[:output_tuples]` exists that connects the `:outputs` and can be transformed into `:connections`.

The running order for computing `:output_tuples` is as follows.

1. The generic `:inherit` logic from `"inherit.recall_recorded_options"` will copy over all non-generic output tuples from the superclass to `:non_symbol_options`, as if they had been provided by a user.
2. Then, [defaulting](#internals-wiring-api-output-tuples-defaulting) from the respective strategy takes place, where default connectors for `:success` etc are merged *before* 1.).
3. User tuples are merged on top, potentially overwriting defaulted options, as it should be.

<%= h4 "Defaulting" %>

Each strategy provides defaulting for the case that no custom wiring is configured.
Defaulting steps such as `"path.step.add_success_connector"` [are added before](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear/blob/v1.2.0/lib/trailblazer/activity/path.rb#L25) `"output_tuples.normalize_output_tuples"`.

Alternatively, as with `"railway.fail.success_to_failure"`, a particular "inherited" connector [step is replaced.](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear/blob/v1.2.0/lib/trailblazer/activity/railway.rb#L44)

This assures that the order in `:non_symbol_options` and the resulting order of `:output_tuples` is

<%= code do %>
[<default tuples>, <inherited tuples>, <user tuples>]
<% end %>

<%= h4 "Custom signals" %>

The Wiring API allows to add outputs along with a new signal to non-nested steps.

<%= code :ruby do %>
step :model,
  Output(Error, :error) => Track(:failure) # When Error is returned, go to failure track.
<% end %>

When using the two-argument form, a `Output::CustomOutput` tuple is created. In `"output_tuples.register_additional_outputs"` this is converted to a `Output::Semantic` after the new signal is registered as a new output on `:outputs`.

The conversion allows all following output tuples code to work with `Output::Semantic`, only.

<%= h4 "Inherit" %>

Several steps in the normalizer supply support for `inherit: true`. It is important to understand here that only custom output tuples are inherited. The `:outputs` option is **not inherited**, and neither are the default output tuples.

1. Non-generic output tuples are marked for recording in `"output_tuples.remember_custom_output_tuples"`. These are stored via the generic inherit logic.
2. Currently, we assume that `strict_outputs = false`. This means we filter out custom output tuples that are not supported by the new step task or activity in `"output_tuples.filter_inherited_output_tuples"`.

    In order to accomplish this, the set of all inherited custom output tuples have to be explicitely computed. at present, we do that via `inherited_recorded_options[:custom_output_tuples]`.

<%= h3 "Connections" %>

Once the `:outputs` variable is computed, and `:output_tuples` are set, the actual connections can be compiled in `"activity.wirings"`, which is a step implemented in `OutputTuples::Connections.compile_wirings`. The returned `:wirings` array contains `Sequence::Search` instances that, during compilation, find the next step for a particular output.

Actually, the term `:wirings` is misleading and should be renamed to `:output_searches`.


<%= h4 "Connectors" %>

It is also possible to build custom connectors that are able to add any number of steps (actually, sequence rows) via the ADDS interface.

<%= h3 "Finalization" %>

The actual `Sequence::Row` is then computed in `"activity.create_row"`. This is where `:wirings` is required. The `:row` is pushed onto `ctx[:adds]` which contains all ADDS additions for this step.

The `Row` instance is just one of potentially many ADDS additions that are applied to the `Sequence` instance.

<%= h4 "Sequence Row" %>

<!--
# ## Test structure
# wiring_api_test.rb Output(...) =>
#   inherit tests are in step_test
 -->

<%= h3 "ADDS Interface" %>

The ADDS interface is implemented in the [`activity` gem](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-activity/blob/v0.15.1/lib/trailblazer/activity/adds.rb). It defines behavior and structures for adding rows to or altering an array or sequence.

It's used for adding steps to the taskWrap pipeline, to normalizers, and to add rows representing steps to the `Sequence` in the `dsl` gem.

An ADDS addition instance is a hash composed like so.

<%= code :ruby do %>
{
  row:    #<Linear::Sequence::Row >,
  insert: Adds::Insert.method(:Append)
}
<% end %>

A `Row` instance has to expose an `#id` method.

The additions are invoked using `Adds.apply_adds`.

<%= h4 "Friendly Interface" %>

The recommended way of creating ADDS additions is the "friendly interface" via `#adds_for`.

Assuming you had an existing pipeline creating like the one in the following snippet.

<%= code "adds-pipe" %>

You can then use the "friendly interface" using `FriendlyInterface.adds_for` to append another element behind `business.task`.

<%= code "adds" %>

Whatsoever, usually you don't need to use the ADDS directly but through `TaskWrap::Extension.WrapStatic` or when working on `dsl`'s sequence code.

<%= h2 "Introspect" %>

<%= h3 "Data" %>

The `#step` DSL allows to save arbitrary data in the activity's `data` field.

<%= code "data_variable", collapse: "meths" %>

Using `Introspect::Graph`, you can now read the `:model_class` variable from the `data` field.

<%= code "data_variable_read", collapse: "meths" %>

This is used internally to store and expose data like `:extensions` (which is part of the Introspect API). It's implemented in the basic normalizer in `"activity.compile_data"`.
