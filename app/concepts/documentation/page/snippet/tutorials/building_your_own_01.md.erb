<%= h2 "Building your own authentication framework with Trailblazer" %>

* If you've never written a library, it's usually best to start in a real app and then extract the logic.
* We will prototype our authentication library in a Rails app and then move it to a separate gem.
* This gem is then used in our app and customized.
* I mostly don't explain why but how. The why I will elaborate in a separate book.
* We don't use Reform or many macros in this first part.
* We don't discuss: mailers, AR (to be covered in the book)
* Book ideas: stronger password, reset verify token, resend account verification token

<%= h3 "Create Account" %>

* Imagine a form with `email`, `password`, and `password_confirm` fields.
* Obviously, the email has to be valid and both passwords need to match.
* When submitted, a controller action will invoke an _operation_ to validate the form data and create a new user in the database along with a hashed password.

<%= code "op" %>


<%= h4 "Naming" %>

* Naming of Trailblazer assets such as operations or contracts follows the convention `concept name::layer::verb`, where the concept name and verb is completely up to you.
* Deeper nesting is possible.

<%= h4 "Operation - The Basics" %>

<%= code "steps" %>

* OP implements all business logic necessary to perform a _function_ of your application.
* Not a god object, it's a delegator that encapsulates vs. controller action and model/SO
* An operation is structured into steps. Those are usually smaller methods composing the logic but adhering to strict encapsulation.
* All `step`s are invoked in the order they are declared in the operation body.
* If one step fails, all following steps are skipped. More on that later.

<%= code "check_email" %>

* A `step` is mostly implemented as an instance method in the operation body. [Any callable objects can be used as a step](/2.1/docs/activity.html#activity-internals-task-interface-instance-method), though.
* Its return value matters: `nil` or `false` will indicate it "failed".
* It receives a `ctx` object that is passed from step to step.
* The keyword arguments can be used to access specific variables from that `ctx`.

<%= h4 "Op - invocation" %>

<%= code "op-call-missing-kw" %>

* TODO: test file/rails setup?
* To run (or _invoke_) an operation you use its `#call` method and pass an options hash.
* Simplified, this will call all steps in their defined order and pass the options hash from step to step.
* The options hash is from now on called `ctx`.
* However, this breaks in the first step `:check_email` because we're expecting an `:email` keyword argument.
    <%= code "ruby" do %>
    def check_email(ctx, email:, **)
    <% end %>
* The ctx contains all variables from that options hash we provided when invoking the operation in the test.
* This `email:` "keyword argument" is automatically extracted by Trailblazer from the ctx object.
* Since we did not pass any `:email` key/value to the operation, this keyword is not available. So let's fix this.

<%= code "op-call-missing-passwords" %>

* We pass an `:email` variable. But this time, it breaks in the next step `passwords_identical?`.
* How do we know? We can see it in the stacktrace, but, hang tight, there's another beautiful way to debug in Trailblazer: `wtf?`.

<%= h4 "Debugging" %>

* The `trailblazer-developer` gem provides the `wtf?` method to run an operation and print the flow.

<%= code "op-call-missing-passwords-wtf" %>

Running the operation using `wtf?` prints the following on the terminal.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/wtf-password.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* When an exception is thrown, it displays the triggering step in light red.
* Tracing the flow is a bit more expensive, so you shouldn't use it in performance-critical production environments.
* It's a beautiful tool especially when you start nesting operations or activities to more complex compounds.
* Let's make this test pass, finally.

<%= h4 "OP Testing, Assertions" %>

By passing all required signup variables we make the test pass.

<%= code "op-call-wtf" %>
<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/create-account-wtf.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* When `call`ed, an operation returns a result object.
* `wtf?` also returns the result object, as it also ran the operation.
* We can figure out if an operation was run successfully by asking the result for `success?` or `failure?`.
* Passing all three required variables, the operation runs all steps.
* The trace shows that both steps were executed successfully.

<%= h4 "Railway" %>

* Let's learn more about steps by breaking things, again.

<%= code "op-call-failure" %>

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/check-email-fail.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* When passing an invalid email, `check_email` fails because the regular expression matching returns false.
* The `check_email` method thus returns false when the email is invalid, signalizing that this step has "failed".
* In the trace, the failing step is marked orange. Or is it brown?
* If a step fails, all remaining steps are skipped and the operation result is a `failure`.
* Why is this?

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/create-account-01.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* Using `step` will place the step on the "success" track (green) which leads to a `success` terminus.
* This is why - with proper input - your `CreateAccount` is successful.
* If a step returns a `nil` or `false` value, the flow deviates to the "failure" track (red), leading to the `failure` terminus.
* This is why the remaining steps on the success track are not executed, for example, when we provided an invalid email address.
* You can place steps on the failure track, too.

<%= h4 "Error handling" %>


<%= code "op-fail", collapse: "meth" %>

* We add two error handling steps to our operation: `email_invalid_msg` and `passwords_invalid_msg`.
* Those are placed after their respective steps.
* Check out how you can also _write_ to the `ctx` object.
* Our next test case asserts that the error messages are correct.

<%= code "op-wrong-email-wrong" %>

* Passing an incomplete email to our operation, we'd expect the error message to complain about just that.
* However, the error handler for the passwords must've been called.
* Let's check the trace.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/create-account-fail-wrong.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* Both handlers have been called!
* The second overriding the first's error message.
* That's because just like `step`, steps placed with `fail` will be executed in their order, as shown below.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/create-account-fails.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* Trailblazer's [Wiring API] allows literally any connections you desire.
* For this specific case, we make every `fail` step connect directly to the `fail_fast` end, not going down the `failure` track.

<%= code "op-fail-fast", collapse: "meth" %>

* Note the `fail_fast: true` for both `fail` steps.
* This results in a flow diagram as below.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/create-account-fail-fast.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* As noted, there are other ways to achieve this. You don't even have to have separate steps for error messages.
* Adding two tests to assert the email and password error messages.

<%= code "email-wrong" %>

* Whatever is written to the `ctx` you can read from the result object in tests, controllers, or other scripts.
* The passwords test now also passes.

<%= code "password-wrong" %>

<%= h4 "Scrambling the password" %>

* When the input is correct, the next step is calculating a scrambled password hash.
* Since passwords should never be stored plain in the database, we use `bcrypt` to encrypt it.

<%= code "op-password-hash", collapse: "meth" %>

* Keyword arguments in steps can also be defaulted, the way we do it for `:password_hash_cost`.
* Some of this code is stolen from Rodauth.
* We write the hashed string to `ctx[:password_hash]`.
* Now, test.

<%= code "password-hash" %>

* After running the operation successfully, the `:password_hash` is now filled with a random 60-character token. This is the encrypted password.

<%= h4 "Set user state" %>

* It's a good idea to set a `state` field on the user, especially if we want to use the `workflow` gem later.

<%= code "op-set-state", collapse: "meth" %>

* Set a `:state` variable.
* So far, this is not limited to a one-word token. It's up to us.
* We write this to the user in the next section.

<%= h4 "Save account" %>

* With an encrypted password in place, it is now time to persist the user to the database.
* Later, we can make our library database-agnostic, for now we will just use the `User` model and ActiveRecord.
* TODO: discuss db-cleaner and Gem/migration setup.
* To persist, we add another step `#save_account` to our operation.

<%= code "op-save-account", collapse: "meth" %>

* This is nothing more than using `User.create()` and passing the sane variables from our operation.
* We write the created model to `ctx[:user]`.
* We can update our happy-path test to check the returned `:user` model.

<%= code "save-account", collapse: "meth" %>

* The persisted `User` model should have the provided email and the hashed password.

<%= h4 "Email must be unique" %>

* Since the `users.email` column acts like a user ID and is `UNIQUE`, we must test what happens when two users with the same email sign up.

<%= code "save-account-test-unique" %>

* The `CreateAccount` operation is run twice with the same input.
* Running this test case fires an exception for the second invocation.

<%= code do %>
ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique: SQLite3::ConstraintException: UNIQUE constraint failed: users.email
<% end %>

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/save-account-error.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* Obviously, the error comes from `save_account`.
* We have to cover this case by catching the `RecordNotUnique` exception that ActiveRecord throws.
* Instead of the exception, we simply want to indicate a failure.
* In TRB, we refrain from exceptions wherever possible and rely on wiring activity outcomes accordingly.
* The `save_account` method needs to handle the potential exception, here's a first version.

<%= code "save-account-def" %>
<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/save-account-fail.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

* By using `begin/rescue` we catch ActiveRecord's uniqueness violation.
* We can later use the macro `Rescue()` from `trailblazer-macro`.
* This time, we can set the error message directly in the method.
* Returning `false` means any further `step`s are not executed and instead the flow diverts to the failure track.
* All tests pass, we can create users in the database with an encryted password and identified by their email address.

<%= h4 "Verify account token" %>

* We also want the account to be confirmed by the email owner. To do so, we send a confirm link to the email address.
* When clicking this link in the email, the user proofs that they signed up using our library.
* The actual confirmation is a separate operation `VerifyAccount`.
* However, we need to compute the verify or confirm token now.
* The confirm token is stored in a separate table `account_verification_tokens`.

<%= code "ruby" do %>
create_table "verify_account_tokens", force: :cascade do |t|
  t.integer "user_id"
  t.text "token"
  t.datetime "created_at", precision: 6, null: false
  t.datetime "updated_at", precision: 6, null: false
  t.index ["token"], name: "index_verify_account_tokens_on_token", unique: true
end
<% end %>

* To compute the `verify_account_token`, two more steps are added to the `CreateAccount` operation.

<%= code "op-verify-token", collapse: "meth" %>

* In `#generate_verify_account_token` we generate a random token to include in the confirmation email.
* The token is generated using `SecureRandom`. Note that this class can be injected, we simply default the `secure_random` keyword argument.
* We need this for testing.
* `#save_verify_account_token` creates a new row in the respective table. Since the token must be unique, we need to catch a `RecordNotUnique` exception.
* The exception is very unlikely to happen but still needs to be covered. If it happens, `CreateAccount` fails with an error message.
* We have to test the happy-path and the uniqueness validation.

<%= code "verify-token" %>

* In addition to the created `User` we now have a matching entry in `verify_account_tokens`.
* To test the uniqueness for the verify token, we need another test.

<%= code "verify-token-unique" %>

* By using `NotRandom` as our random string generator we can make sure we get two identical tokens.
* The second run fails as we expect.
* The trace demonstrates this.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/book/verify-account-fail.png", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

<%= h4 "Send verify account email" %>

* Last thing to do is send a welcome email to the user with the verify account link in it.

<%= code "op-verify-email", collapse: "meth" %>

* The verify token is prefixed with the user ID to mitigate brute force attacks (stolen from Rodauth).
* `AuthMailer` sends the email.
* Note how the operation computes the final token, not the mailer or controller.
* Be wary what you add to `ctx` in the op (e.g. `verify_account_token`). This is public API you're creating.

<%= code "verify-email" %>

* We need to use `assert_emails` provided by Rails to catch the email. This is poor design in Rails.
* The email we can test by accessing the rendered version from the result.
* We make sure it contains the verify account link with the token.
* Our first Tyrant operation is finished.
